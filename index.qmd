## Welcome!

My name is Ruby Krasnow *(she/her)* and I am an aspiring quantitative marine ecologist interested in using modeling and data science to support sustainable fisheries management and marine aquaculture.

## Education

In January 2025, I will be starting a PhD in Marine Biology at the University of Maine School of Marine Sciences. My primary advisor will be Dr. Damian Brady, who leads a large lab group focused on [Marine Sciences of Aquaculture, Fisheries, and Renewable Energy](https://umaine.edu/bradylab/). I have been working with the Brady lab since 2022 and am thrilled to continue my education as a member of such an exciting, collaborative, and passionate group of researchers.

**B.A., Biology** - Clark University, Worcester, MA \| Expected: Dec. 2024

-   Minor in Mathematics
-   GPA: 4.0

**Semester in Environmental Science** - Marine Biological Laboratory, Woods Hole, MA \| Fall 2023

## Interests

-   Kelp aquaculture

    -   Kelp Dynamic Energy Budget models
    -   Spatial modeling for aquaculture site selection

-   Quantitative fisheries

    -   I am especially interested stock assessment/population dynamics models for economically important crustacean species, particularly data-poor species like the Jonah crab (*Cancer borealis*)
    -   Estimating crustacean size at maturity from allometric data

-   Synthesis research: systematic reviews, meta-analysis, interdisciplinary collaborations

-   Open and reproducible data science: [FAIR](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/) (findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable) data


-   Statistical analysis, modeling, and data visualization in R

    -   Generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) and related techniques
    -   Simulation (dynamical) modeling
    -   Spatiotemporal modeling (including geostatistics and time series analysis)
