## Welcome!

My name is Ruby Krasnow *(she/her)* and I am a quantitative marine ecologist focused on using modeling and data science to support sustainable fisheries management and marine aquaculture.

## Education

In January 2025, I will be starting a PhD in Marine Biology at the University of Maine School of Marine Sciences. My primary advisor will be Dr. Damian Brady, who leads a large lab group focused on [Marine Sciences of Aquaculture, Fisheries, and Renewable Energy](https://umaine.edu/bradylab/). I have been working with the Brady lab since 2022 and am thrilled to continue my education as a member of such an exciting, collaborative, and passionate group of researchers.

**B.A., Biology** - Clark University, Worcester, MA \| Expected: Dec. 2024

-   Minor in Mathematics
-   GPA: 4.0

**Semester in Environmental Science** - Marine Biological Laboratory, Woods Hole, MA \| Fall 2023

## Research

### Methods & Approaches

-   Synthesis research: systematic reviews, meta-analysis, interdisciplinary collaborations

-   Open and reproducible data science: [FAIR](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/) (findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable) data

-   Statistical analysis, modeling, and data visualization in R

    -   Generalized linear models, mixed-effects models, and related methods
    -   Dynamical/state-space modeling
        -   Applications of ordinary and partial differential equations in ecology
    -   Bayesian analysis
    -   Spatiotemporal modeling (including geostatistics and time series analysis)
    -   R package development

### Applications

-   Marine aquaculture

    -   Dynamic Energy Budget models of cultivated sugar kelp
    -   Spatial modeling for aquaculture site selection
    -   Quantifying, predicting, and mitigating biofouling in kelp and shellfish aquaculture

-   Quantitative fisheries

    -   I am especially interested stock assessment and population dynamics models for economically important crustacean species, particularly data-poor species like the Jonah crab (*Cancer borealis*)
    -   Estimating crustacean size at maturity from allometric data
